# Slack Emojis

This is a personal collection of curated Slack emojis for use in my own Slack workspaces.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `emojis/`: This directory contains all of the emoji image files.
- `generate-readme.md`: This script takes the contents in `_README.md`, appends to it a list of the image files in `emojis/`, and overrwrites the contents of `README.md`.
- `README.md`: The repository's README file. This file is generated by running `generate-readme.sh`. This file will be overwritten by the script to generate it.
- `_README.md`: The static content for the repository's README file. Update this file for README content.
